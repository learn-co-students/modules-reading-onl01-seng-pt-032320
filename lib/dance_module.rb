# We'll code our `Dance` module inside the `lib/dance_module.rb` file. Open up that file and define your module with the following code:

# ```ruby
# module Dance
# end
# ```

# Let's give our `Dance` module some fabulous moves:

# ```ruby
# module Dance
#    def twirl
#      "I'm twirling!"
#    end

#   def jump
#      "Look how high I'm jumping!"
#   end

#    def pirouette
#      "I'm doing a pirouette"
#    end

#    def take_a_bow
#      "Thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure to dance for you all."

#    end
# end
# ```
